## Mirror Mirror

### Project Description

The idea of capturing oneself/essence through visual means has been a long standing practice of people. But before the onslaught of the modern-day selfie and ease at which images can be produced, artists used a variety of mediums and styles in attempts to capture themselves. **Mirror Mirror**, a visual/art based app, aims to showcase the development of the self-portrait/selfie through time, style and place by using self-portraits from art collections, starting with [The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)
<br/>
<br/>
The app will also give users an opportunity to add their own self-portrait to the overall collection and timeline. The medium/style of the self-portrait is up to the user but it must be a url link to upload to the site.
