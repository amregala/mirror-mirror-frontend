## Mirror Mirror

### Project Description

The idea of capturing oneself/essence through visual means has been a long standing practice of people. But before the onslaught of the modern-day selfie and ease/rate at which images can be produced, artists used a variety of mediums and styles in attempts to capture themselves. **Mirror Mirror**, a visual/art based app, aims to showcase the development of the self-portrait/selfie through time, style and place by using self-portraits from art collections, starting with [The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)
<br/> 
The app will also give users an opportunity to add their own self-portrait to the overall collection and timeline. Though the medium/style of the self-portrait will not be restricted in any way, the number of uploads per year will be. Users will only be allowed to upload one image, per year (the user can delete their one upload from the year and upload another image at any point within the year but will be contained to one per year). The hope in limiting users, is that they will be more thoughtful of their self-portrait/upload for the year. The app aims to maybe bring back a bit more thoughtfulness to the act of documenting oneself and state in time.
